# CS120B SnakeGame

Final project for CS/EE 120B at UCR<br />
Introduction to Embedded Systems

## Introduction
Snake is a simple game in which the player controls a line (snake) and must collect fruit which are randomly placed on the screen, by moving over it, which increases the length of the line by 1 each time a fruit is consumed. The object of the game is to survive as long as possible and grow as much as you can without colliding with the snakeâ€™s own body.

## Hardware
### Parts List
The hardware that was used in this design is listed below. The equipment that was not taught in this course has been bolded. 

* ATMega1284 microcontroller
* **8x8 LED Matrix**
* **2 x SN74HC595 Shift Registers**
* **Joystick**
* 16x2 LCD Screen
* 2 x Push Buttons

## Complexities
* Enabling and Writing to the Led Matrix
* Integrating and calibrating the joystick
* Using EEPROM to save the high score
* Creating custom characters on the LCD screen
